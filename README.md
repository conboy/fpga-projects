# Digital Logic Projects

## Project 1
Creating a Vivado project and running the source and constraints file.

## Project 2
Mapping switch to a LED.

## Project 3
Mapping all switches to their corresponding LEDs.

## Project 4
1. Mapping all switches to their reverse corresponding LEDs in the Verilog source.
2. Mapping all switches to their reverse corresponding LEDs in the Constraints source.

## Project 5
Mapping switches to their corresponding index in a seven-segment display. Then use the pushbuttons to choose which seven-segment display to light up.
